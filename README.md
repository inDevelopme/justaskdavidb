Participants will work under the guidance of a coach to complete open-source initiatives, with tasks being specific to the individual's selected coaching track (e.g. Programming, DevOps, Content Strategy). When necessary, participants shall be granted access to software licenses, credentails, and information to complete tasks.

## Tracks 

Participants can choose to receive guidance from one of three tracks:
- programming.
- devops.
- content strategy.

### Programming

This GSD-IT track focuses heavily on programming concepts and best practice. Git, Composer, Docker, Jetbrain IDEs, Laravel (PHP), and Flask (Python) represent some of the products and technologies used within this track. 

***Programming: General Tasks***  

Participants will work through a series of tasks meticulously designed to foster growth in programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.). They will tackle debugging scenarios, conditional statements, iterative programming, practice user input and output handling, and build basic user interfaces. Other tasks will include self-exploration in data structures, algorithms, version control, etc. to participate on small projects designed to allow application of newly acquired knowledge and skills.  

***Programming: Benefits to Participant***  

Consistent engagement in programming will help partcipants build a solid foundation in programming, enabling them to take on more complex challenges. Participants will also develop a portfolio of skills and work experience for the world to see!
