### Introduction 
The Dunning-Kruger effect occurs when a person overestimates their abilities in a certain area because of a lack of knowledge or skill. However, this effect can also make those who are very skilled in a certain area to assume that everyone must also be as skilled, causing them to underestimate their ability. And this effect can influence an IT professional in many ways.

### The Cause
The Dunning-Kruger Effect can be difficult to recognize, especially while it is occurring. For example, it can be difficult for a freshman in college, a junior developer, or a new hire to be consciously aware of mistakes or shortcomings while performing an activity. This observation can be directly related to a lack of experience, skill, or training and is not at all related to capability or willingness to learn. 

### Underestimation by Seniors 
Has someone declared a task as "easy" because it was easy for them? Such an individual may underestimate the difficulty others may have performing a task. Alternatively, experienced individuals can underestimate the difficult they will face when performing a task. In short, people overly confident in their own abilities are unaware of their own lack of knowledge or skill. This overconfidence happens because people become unaware of their own skills relative to world around him. 

### Underestimation by Juniors
Have you ever thought a task would be easy only for it to become an insurmountable one? New hires may underestimate the difficulty of a similar task because of the "ease" by which they previously completed a similar task. It happens *all the time.* It is very true that "you do not know what you do not know." The new hire may have been unaware of the challenges that lie ahead, challenges that a more senior hire would have seen. The person might even be a below-average worker who just "got lucky" on a few tasks. Unfortunately, the person became overconfident—the Dunning Kruger effect at its finest!  

### Estimation by Everyone
Charles Darwin, in his book *The Descent of Man* [^darwin] wrote, "Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge." In short, unfamiliarity in a topic can cause a person to be ignorantly confident.

****I'm a Professional Race Car Driver!****  
On a small scale, individuals can make erroneous decisions based on an estimation of their own abilities, which could be based on a fallacy. For example, a 1986 comparative study on US drivers[^drivers] concluded that 80% of people considered themselves as "above average drivers". This means that saying that 80% of US drivers considered themselves better than 50% of the population. Does that sound right to you?  

****I'm an Indispensable Employee!****  
Another study[^developers] founded that 42% of employees in a software engineering company assessed their own performance as the top 5%. These employees overestimate their own abilities and may end up looking down on others. This can rob team members of valuable opportunities to learn, grow, and develop as IT professionals.

### Conclusion
The Dunning Kruger Effect is a cause-and-effect outcome based on a person's misunderstanding. These misgivings can happen without awareness or knowledge. It is important for IT professionals to understand that it is expected for them to make the erroneous decision from time to time. And it is expected for IT professionals to sometimes over-or underestimate by a lot. The goal is to never let the Dunning-Kruger Effect influence your perception of yourself or others!
