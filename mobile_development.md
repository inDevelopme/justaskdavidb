# Learning Mobile Android Development 

## Introduction
Mobile development is essentially the creation of software for smartphones, tablets, and digital assistants,
primarily focusing on the Android and iOS operating systems. This document provides a brief overview of what 
I have learned and accomplished while learning mobile development on Android through Google's Online Training.

## My Background 
Before joining JustAskDavidB’s coaching program, I had no prior programming or development experience. 
I’m currently in my senior year of high school, and I’ve been able to acquire knowledge about programming and 
development before entering college. This will significantly aid me in understanding my computer science classes. 
So far, I’ve learned about various data types such as Int, Double, Boolean, String, and Float.

## Technology Needed
Below, I have listed the technology you will need to start learning about mobile development when creating your first app.

### Operating System
A computer running a 64-bit version of Windows (8, 10, or 11), Linux, macOS (10.14 Mojave or later), or ChromeOS 

### [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Resources Used
Below are resources that I used and found to be helpful when learning Kotlin and mobile development.

### [LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com/)
LinkedIn Learning offers a wide array of expert tutorials and courses through video lessons, tests, 
and certificates, empowering users to improve their skills and progress in their careers, 
fostering both professional and personal growth. Despite the wealth of information available on LinkedIn, 
when it comes to learning Kotlin, the videos I attempted to learn from were not only outdated but also quite 
vague in guiding me on how to effectively learn and use Kotlin. 

### [Google’s Online Training](https://developer.android.com/)
While learning from Google’s Online Training, I was able to create my first app on Android Studio, 
and it was a lot less complicated than I thought it would be. Currently, I’m learning more about how 
I can progress in my app development. Creating your first app takes a lot of patience and understanding of what does what. 
Google’s Online Training provides instructions as you progress through the courses, which helps a lot, especially if you lack experience. 

### Kotlin
Kotlin is a programming language that was developed by JetBrains. It's well known for its compatibility with Java while also 
helping with many programming errors as you work, which also makes it a popular programming language when it comes to Android app development.

### [Kotlin Playground](https://developer.android.com/training/kotlinplayground)
Write, compile, and run Kotlin code directly in your browser with a Kotlin playground, 
as there are no setups to install before you can begin your coding practice.
