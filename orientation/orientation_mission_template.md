# Orientation
We feel that professional development is like starting a journey into fitness or building your first player profile in NBA 2K. That is why JustAskDavidB focuses on setting up a solid foundation for all its players. 

## Consultation
You get four meetings free as part of the orientation process. The first one is how you got here in the first place. And the last one covers the conclusion of the orientation process. Check these off as you complete each one. 

- [ ] Introduction Consultation: Your professional needs and desires.
- [ ] Office Hour: Meeting Others Like You
- [ ] Debriefing: Are you staying in the program?
