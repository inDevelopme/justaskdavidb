# Orientation: Welcome to your first day!
This document was made to help newcomers set up all the software that they will need to actively learn and participate in the JustAskDavidB Coaching Program.

##  Downloading and Setting Up Software

### [Jetbrains](https://account.jetbrains.com/login)
We use JetBrains products for web development.  This includes PHPStorm for PHP development, DataGrip for SQL and database interaction, and Pycharm for Python development. Downloading the trials is fine because a JetBrains license will be purchased for you as part of the JustAskDavidB Coaching Program. You will receive an email from JetBrains to complete your registration within the first fifteen days. After logging into JetBrains, “Authorization Successful” should appear on screen.

#### 1. [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/#section=windows)
Download the program for your OS and run through the installation. After installing Pycharm, open Pycharm and run through the setup wizard. Do not worry there are no wrong answers :)

#### 2. [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/download/#section=windows)
Download the default “.exe” version. Run the datagrip-2023.2.1.exe file to start the Installation Wizard. Follow all the steps suggested by the wizard. Pay special attention to the corresponding installation options. 

#### 3. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)
Download the default “.exe” version and install PyCharm. After setting up a trial on Jetbrains, click the blue “Activate” button that should appear. Then click “Continue” at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. PyCharm is now available to be used. 

### [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
Click the blue “Download Docker Desktop” button and then open “Docker Desktop Installer”. Allow the app to make changes to your device. Follow the instructions on the installer. 

### [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
Download Github’s setup, then install its desktop version.

## Setup 3rd Party Accounts
These are accounts that are needed to perform development work in the JustAskDavidB Coaching Program:  

- [GitHub account](https://github.com/dkbaldwin/indevelopme-simlite)
- [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/)  
- [Free Personal Docker account](https://www.docker.com/pricing)

_Note: There will be no need to create a Jira account, as one will already be made for you, and the invite will be sent via email._
